# yle_tekstitv_archiver
a simple python script (3.4, haven't tested on 2.7, probably won't work) that allows you to download all the YLE (Finland's national public-broadcasting company) teletext pages for archival purposes.

#instructions
-download the repository</br>
-run "tekstitv_archiver.py"</br>
-go see a movie, clean your home, play videogames or something (the script takes a break between each request (purely out of respect). With lots of pages and subpages it will take a long time to get all the pages)

#arguments
useknown - use pages listed in the file knownpages.txt (100_01,100_02,100_04,200_01 etc.)</br>
savenew  - save found pages to knownpages.txt to save time in the future
